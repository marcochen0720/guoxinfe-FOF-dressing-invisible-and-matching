This is a project focusing on the factors regarding Fund of Fund(FOF). By calculating the dressing, invisible, and matching factors, we can evaluate the performance of certain funds. Here we use funds that trade mainly on stocks.

What we need are the holdings of the funds, the return rate of all stocks in the market, and the return rate of the funds.
