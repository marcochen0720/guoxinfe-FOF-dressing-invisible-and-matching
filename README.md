# guoxinfe-FOF-dressing-invisible-and-matching

This is a project focusing on the alpha regarding Fund of Fund(FOF). By calculating the dressing alpha, the invisible alpha, and the matching alpha, we can evaluate the performance of certain funds. Here we use funds that trade mainly on stocks.

What we need are the holding of certain funds, the return rate of all stocks in the market, and the return rate of the funds.
